`> writes entire systems alone 

`> makes video on the internet actually work 

`> builds QEMU, virtualization becomes normal 

`> writes a C compiler for fun, it’s stupid fast 

`> implements JavaScript correctly, not loudly 

`> wins contests by finishing everything 

`> no hype, no blog, no brand 

`> drops code, vanishes
