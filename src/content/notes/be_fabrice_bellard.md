<p>> writes entire systems alone

<p>> makes video on the internet actually work 

<p>> builds QEMU, virtualization becomes normal 

<p>> writes a C compiler for fun, it’s stupid fast 

<p>> implements JavaScript correctly, not loudly 

<p>> wins contests by finishing everything 

<p>> no hype, no blog, no brand 

<p>> drops code, vanishes
